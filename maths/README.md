# Maths Folder

I mainly use LaTeX here to write notes, and solve questions, as my handwriting isn't the best.

## Compiling

To compile any `.tex` file, simply run the following command:

```bash
pdflatex {file}.tex
```

>ðŸ’¡ Make sure to replace {file} with the actual filename.

### Real-time (Optional)

To compile LaTeX in real-time, I personally like to use [Real-Time-LaTeX](https://github.com/stevenengler/Real-Time-LaTeX), but you can also use something else.
